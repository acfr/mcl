pyITS Maintenance
=========================

This section automatically documents ``todo`` items located in the source code
and undocumented packages, modules, functions, classes and methods. The goal is
to eliminate all items in this section.

Source Code Todo items
----------------------

List of ``.. todo::`` directives automatically generated by Sphinx.

.. todolist::

Undocumented Python objects
---------------------------

.. note::

    The list generated by ``sphinx-build -b coverage`` is by no means 
    comprehensive. For instance, it currently (version 1.2.2) does not appear
    to detect undocumented methods.
